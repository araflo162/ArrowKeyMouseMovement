How to use/download:
just download the exe and run It 
                              
If you dont trust the exe you can see the code in the "[ArrowKeyMouseMovement.ahk](https://github.com/araflo162/ArrowKeyMouseMovement/blob/main/ArrowKeyMouseMovement.ahk)" File. You can also compile the EXE yourself with AutoHotkey
